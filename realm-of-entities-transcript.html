[KF] Remix: to combine 
or edit existing materials
to produce something new. 

[Voice] This is a glimpse of tomorrow.

[KF] Everything is a remix—  
appropriated
	transformed
		& subverted

copy     transform     & combine

[Voice] Open your eyes. 

[GK] One mode alone won’t do it. 
A multimodal lens
gives you the possibility 
of seeing	  more. 

[KF] Creation requires influence. 

[JS] A soundtrack for our study
of humanity. 

[AB] Knowledge is design-dependent.

[KF] The act of creation
is surrounded by a fog of myths. 

[KF] Everything is a remix –  
appropriated
	transformed		
		& subverted

copy     transform     & combine

[Voice] Open your eyes.

[DG ] The music you hear was machine generated. 

[PDM] Remixing implies a reverence
for the original. 

[Voice] Recordings require
a critical interpretation
to give us any connection
to the past. 

A unique liminal 
dystopian space

nostalgic yearnings 

for an idealized other realm
an alternate reality
of the could have been.

[GK] Music has different kinds of entities.

[KF] Everything is a remix—  
appropriated
	transformed
		& subverted

copy     transform     & combine

[Voice] Open your eyes.

[GK] What does the culture
make available for us
to make our meanings with?

[AB] Remix as a strategy for decolonizing
classification systems

[PDM] digital literacy 

music
	collage
	          &           sampling

are a beautiful reflection 
of that democratization of culture

[GK] combinations of things

[AB] entangled relations

[GK] from linearity to modularity

my interest is to produce something
which matches the interest 
of the people you have in mind
as visitors to this site

[KF] Everything is a remix—  
appropriated
	transformed
		& subverted

copy     transform     & combine

[Voice] Open your eyes.

[Distorted Voice] an alternate reality

Music fades
