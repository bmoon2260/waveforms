  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: sans-serif;">
in those days
we wore the crown

my body is my home
& everywhere else
is where I stay 

there’s a lot of things
that you miss
while running

I believe that things
fall     apart
to fall together
to fall     apart 

I thought I knew all of me
until I met all of you 

finding unlikely entry points
those moments of pause
where, like, we could reconvene

all these ways of speaking
that I have are like
valid ways of being

we all get flustered
by our reflection
showing up unannounced

& I could tell you
you mean the world to me

I could tell you
you mean the moon & stars
you mean the one candle lit
in a dark room
you mean the one squad lit
in a classroom

my body is my home
& everywhere else
is where I stay 

there’s a lot of things
that you miss
while running

I believe that things
fall     apart
to fall together
to fall     apart 

I thought I knew all of me
until I met all of you

like slam was a place where
I felt like I was seen
& people could connect with me

it doesn’t matter what you call it
insecurity is a type-everybody emotion

there’s so much we can, we can
do & be for each other

I think my focus 
is like oriented towards like
truth-seeking

how do you bend words
like that?

it made like learning & school
feel like magic

my body is my home
& everywhere else
is where I stay 

there’s a lot of things
that you miss
while running

I believe that things
fall     apart
to fall together
to fall     apart 

I thought I knew all of me
until I met all of you

the images are what guide
the words

& when the adults
would visit our floating world
they’d leave in a daydream
where their memories archived
returned on waves 
of warmth & glee

this was our power

honoring memory

no matter what
this is a part of
my identity &
this community is part
of who I am

yeah, I want to create that space
for people

& the EN-ER-GY!

my body is my home
& everywhere else
is where I stay 

there’s a lot of things
that you miss
while running

I believe that things
fall     apart
to fall together
to fall     apart 

I thought I knew all of me
until I met all of you

listening to a poem
& letting it sit...sit with me
& letting it like rest 
like snowfall blanketing
& just letting it cover me

so like learning about
knowledge of self
caused me to really 
think about like 
my own heritage

& like
my own Blackness

two Trinidadian parents
a history in Trinidad & Tobago
in Barbados

& it’s like
all of that is part of my identity
as well as my lived experience
& culture here
as a Black person
born in America
to two Trinidadian people

that was an extremely
spiritual space
