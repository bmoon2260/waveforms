our narratives seemed
to flow into one another
as we told stories		         you know / 
almost like rivers merging	         if it inspires one person / 
with the ocean 		         then it’s gonna be worth it
as the waters empty 
the sedimentary deposits						What type of world
of story into one							 do we want to see?
larger collective body
of experience

what I want
is a world in which
it is easier for us to Love

so you have to 
listen

enter as an uncertainty 
&amp; when asked what you are
when you exit say
you are becoming

listen

that was&mdash;
an extremely spiritual space

narrative is radical
creating us 
as the very moment
it is being created

I’ve noticed
I am my best teacher
or creating my best teaching
when I am co-authoring 

everything I’m not
makes me everything
I am 

I’d like to think of it 
as Radical Love

<em>Radical Love</em>

vividly inventing
the very identity
of everything

there’s so much
we can, we can
do &amp; be
for each other

you mean 
I thought I knew
all of me
until I met all of you

you mean magic
&amp; holy &amp; sorcerer
you mean depth & ocean
&amp; I am a wanderer
still not a swimmer
I clung to the sides
of your Everything

&amp; I could tell you
you mean the world to me
I could tell you
you mean the moon &amp; stars

you mean the one candle
lit in a dark room
you mean the one squad 
lit in the classroom

to see the profound effect
that it has on someone
five, ten, fifteen years later

we’re forever in process
&amp; on our way
as we dream
forward

ready to imagine 
another world &amp;
ready to fight for it

I know at the very least
I can still get to wear the crown 
&amp; that would never
have to end

how lovely it is 
this thing
we have done together
